https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM_fG7Xs=/?share_link_id=206225194466

## Currently working on
- Removing prediction by Encoder
- Area manipulation to force field
- Change loss to be only based on prediction sequence since observed sequence now is equal to the ground truth
- Update new logic to also run on CUDA (GPU) instead of cpu
